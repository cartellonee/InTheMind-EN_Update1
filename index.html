			<p style="position: absolute; top: 120px; left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%);">Hi guys! I want to officially announce my new project. The "In the Mind" project is my new game I'm developing. This game is about our protagonist, Ren, who, to help a friend in a coma, manages to create technology to access his memories and wake him up. To do so, he has to go through various memories: the good ones, the medium ones, and the bad ones (as well as other areas that I won't tell you about now so as not to spoil too much ;) )</p>
